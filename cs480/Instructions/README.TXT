The application takes Covid-19 data and compare/contrast with Travel data,
Stock Market Data (4 Common Stocks), and Unemployment data for 200 countries!

There is a total of 3 navigation tabs: [Travel, Market, and Unemployment]

Travel Tab:
  The graph is interactable by moving your mouse over it.
  Users are able to hide different set of data by click the name of the data.
  The line graphs allows users to easily see if there is any correspondence between
  the increase in covid-19 cases and other "affect" industries.

Market Tab:
  The graph is also interactable and very similar to Travel graph where users
  are allowed to hide data.
  The bar graph scaled with the y-axis on the right and the line graph is scaled
  with the y-axis on the left.
  The bar graph allowed users to quickly see that some stock market where affected
  by the covid-19 but some like Amazon did not and actually increased their stock prices.

Unemployment Tab:
  This allows users to search up a specific location (e.g. United States) and
  will return the data corresponding to that location.
  When the "Clear" button is pressed it will clear your searches and display
  all 200 countries data.
  NOTE: Not all locations provide an unemployment rate, hence the "Data Not Available"
